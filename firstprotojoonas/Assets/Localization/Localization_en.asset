    m_Localized: 'Plastic is commonly used in the take-away industry. Most straws,
      cup lids and single use utensils are made from plastic. Additionally, some
      food packaging is often made using plastic, and some services deliver food
      using plastic bags.


      Most plastic can be recycled at plastic recycling
      points, but for example PVC- plastic can not be recycled this way. PVC- plastic
      is recognized by the triangle symbol with a 3 inside it on the packaging. Hard
      plastic, such as a bucket can also not be recycled this way, and plastic must
      be clean before recycling.


      During recycling plastic is sorted, and
      it is used to make for example plastic bags and trash bags.'

    m_Localized: 'Cushion board-, cardboard-, paper- and liquid board packagin as
      well as industrial fiber packaging are industrial  and consumer packaging made
      using renewable woodfiber. Fiber packagin is also called paper- and cardboard
      packaging.


      Before recycling cardboard packaging should be cleaned,
      dried and flattened.


      When ordering take-away, for example pizza boxes,
      burger- and french fry packaging and the paper bag that the order comes in
      are to be recycled as cardboard.


      Recycled cardboard is transported
      to a cardboard factory, where plastic coating is separated for use in energy
      production, and aluminium coating for recycling purposes. The leftover cardboardfiber
      is used to produce cushion board, packaging cardboard, envelopes, laminated
      paper and toilet paper rolls.

    m_Localized: 'Organic waste of course includes food leftovers and other throwaway
      food items. This also includes fruit peels and other things left over from
      preparing food, such as the waste left from fish cleaning. When ordering food
      or dining at restaurants a napkin is most often included, and those also should
      be recycled alongside organic waste. If you drink coffee or tee, it is important
      to remember to recycle coffee filters and tea bags as organic waste.


      Two
      things can be done to recycled organic waste. It can either be turned into
      biogas, which is used as fuel, or it can be composted, and the resulting soil
      can be used in for example agriculture. If organic waste is not recycled correctly,
      it will produce greenhouse gasses that are harmful to the planet, which is
      why it is always important to recycle organic waste if possible.'

    m_Localized: 'When ordering take-away, it sometimes comes with aluminium packaging
      and aluminium foil, which are considered metal waste. Metal packaging for food
      should be washed before recycling.


      Metal waste is delivered to be used
      as raw material both in Finland and abroad. Recycled metal is used for new
      metal packaging and other products as well. Aluminium can be recycled endlessly
      without it weakening. Of all the aluminium ever produced about 75% is still
      in use today.'

    m_Localized: "Recycling means using waste in the production of new products.
      When waste is sorted correctly, they are used to make new things used in everyday
      life. Recycling reduces raw material- and energy consumption and thus helps
      nature. Additionally the need to use newly harvested material to produce things
      lessens.\n\nThe environmental footprint of products made with recycled mateiral
      is significantly smaller than other products. Packaging material circulates
      in society. Metal packaging waste and other small metal can be used for example
      in bicycles, glass packaging is often reused and cardboard is used for various
      spools and for instance the laminate used in playground attractions. \nJust
      like all other waste, the recycling of take-away packaging is a concrete environmental
      act that anyone can make!"
